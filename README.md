# ibert
The fork of Kablink Collaboration Software: https://sourceforge.net/projects/kablink/

The Kablink doesn't provide building installer. The first goal of this project is to update the build 
process to gradle (the orginal Project use Ant) and implement installer. It should be possible to Kablink to Ibert, 
the backward update process is in the moment not guaranteed.
